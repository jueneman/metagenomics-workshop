Setting up your de.NBI Cloud SimpleVM instance
==============================================

As metagenome assemblies require a lot of compute resources, we will run the tutorial
in the `de.NBI Cloud <http://cloud.denbi.de>`. Each workshop participant will start a 'SimpleVM' instance
and run all jobs on it. All necessary software tools have been pre-installed on this VM.

After your SimpleVM has been launched, use the X2Go Client to connect to your VM.
