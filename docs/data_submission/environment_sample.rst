Submitting an environment sample
==================

There are two ways to submit a sample to ENA (the same as for studies):

1) Using the Webinterface
-----------------------
The Webinterface for the dev submission database can be found at: https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/login

You could follow this guide: https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples/interactive.html

2) Registering a sample programmatically
-----------------------
... using the linux command line tool ``curl``.

As for the study submission, we will also use this approach in this short course. 

First, create a work folder for submissions and a subfolder for the sample files::

  mkdir -p /mnt/submission/assembly/sample/
  cd /mnt/submission/assembly/sample

Create submission.xml
^^^^^^^^^^
The next thing you need to to is to create a file submission.xml with the following content::
  
  <SUBMISSION>
     <ACTIONS>
        <ACTION>
           <ADD/>
        </ACTION>
     </ACTIONS>
  </SUBMISSION>

You can use an editor like ``gedit`` to do so. It is actually the same file as the submission.xml for the study (except the HOLD part) so you could just copy that as well.

Get the correct ENA checklist
^^^^^^^^^^

The next thing, you need to do, is to identify the correct checklist for your sample. Checklists can be browsed here, look for example for "environmental":
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists

Since we have an artifical dataset let's choose this checklist for example:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERC000025


Create sample.xml
^^^^^^^^^^

There are a number of fields to be filled. You can download the XML file to see what can be filled out. Since this is a test submission, 
we will reduce that to the mandatory fields only::

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <SAMPLE_SET>
    <SAMPLE alias="MT5176">
      <TITLE>human gastric microbiota, mucosal</TITLE>
      <SAMPLE_NAME>
			  <TAXON_ID>FILL THAT</TAXON_ID>
			  <SCIENTIFIC_NAME>FILL THAT</SCIENTIFIC_NAME>
			  <COMMON_NAME>FILL THAT</COMMON_NAME>
      </SAMPLE_NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>DESCRIPTION</DESCRIPTION>
      <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTES>   
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>ENA-CHECKLIST</TAG>
				  <VALUE>ERC000025</VALUE>
			  </SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>project name</TAG>
				  <VALUE>PROJECT NAME</VALUE>
			  </SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>sequencing method</TAG>
				  <VALUE>SEQUENCING METHOD</VALUE>
			  </SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>collection date</TAG>
				  <VALUE>DATE</VALUE>
			  </SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>geographic location (country and/or sea)</TAG>
				  <VALUE>country</VALUE>
			  </SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>        
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>geographic location (latitude)</TAG>
				  <VALUE>latitude</VALUE>
			  </SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>  
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>geographic location (longitude)</TAG>
				  <VALUE>longitude </VALUE>
			  </SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>   
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>broad-scale environmental context</TAG>
				  <VALUE>Report the major environmental system the sample or specimen came from. The system(s) identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. in the desert or a rainforest). We recommend using subclasses of EnvO’s biome class: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000428. EnvO documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/Using-ENVO-with-MIxS. </VALUE>
			  </SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>   
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>local environmental context</TAG>
				  <VALUE>Report the entity or entities which are in the sample or specimen’s local vicinity and which you believe have significant causal influences on your sample or specimen. We recommend using EnvO terms which are of smaller spatial grain than your entry for "broad-scale environmental context". Terms, such as anatomical sites, from other OBO Library ontologies which interoperate with EnvO (e.g. UBERON) are accepted in this field. EnvO documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/Using-ENVO-with-MIxS. </VALUE>
			  </SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>   
        <SAMPLE_ATTRIBUTE>
				  <TAG>environmental medium</TAG>
				  <VALUE>Report the environmental material(s) immediately surrounding the sample or specimen at the time of sampling. We recommend using subclasses of 'environmental material' (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010483). EnvO documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/Using-ENVO-with-MIxS . Terms from other OBO ontologies are permissible as long as they reference mass/volume nouns (e.g. air, water, blood) and not discrete, countable entities (e.g. a tree, a leaf, a table top). </VALUE>

    </SAMPLE>

Submit the sample
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, it is time to submit::

  CHANGE THAT curl -u $ENA_USER:$ENA_PWD -F "SUBMISSION=@submission.xml" -F "PROJECT=@study.xml" "https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit/"

Make sure to use wwwdev to submit to the ENA test server.
