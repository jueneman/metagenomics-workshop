Kraken Taxonomic Sequence Classification System
===============

GTDB-Tk is a software toolkit for assigning objective taxonomic 
classifications to bacterial and archaeal genomes based on the 
`Genome Database Taxonomy GTDB <https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org>`_. 
It is designed to work with recent 
advances that allow hundreds or thousands of metagenome-assembled 
genomes (MAGs) to be obtained directly from environmental samples. 
It can also be applied to isolate and single-cell genomes. 

See the `GTDBTk homepage <https://ecogenomics.github.io/GTDBTk/index.html>`_ 
for more info.

First, we need to download the GTDB database files. The database is pretty
big (33 Gb), so even downloading it from our local copy in the de.NBI Cloud
will take a couple of minutes. After downloading, we need to extract the
tar archive (please be patient ;)::

  cd /mnt
  wget https://openstack.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de:8080/swift/v1/denbi-mg-course/gtdbtk_r95_data.tar.gz
  tar xvzf gtdbtk_r95_data.tar.gz
  
Now we need to set an environment variable that stores the path to
the database::

  export GTDBTK_DATA_PATH=/mnt/release95
  
Next, let's assign taxonomic labels to our binning results using
GTDB-Tk::

  cd /mnt/WGS-data/megahit_out/maxbin
  gtdbtk classify_wf --extension fasta --cpus 14 --genome_dir . --out_dir gtdbtk_out
